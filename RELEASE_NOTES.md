# Release Notes v2.2.1

This release fixes a regression from v2.2.0 where the nucleus fails to obtain
TES credentials.

# Release Notes v2.2.0

This release includes support for pulling images from container registries,
including Docker and public/private ECR.

## New with this release

- Added support for container image artifact URIs. Prepend `docker:` to valid
  image names to declare them as artifacts (i.e.
  `docker:registry/image[:tag|@digest]`). Missing images are pulled when
  deploying a component with Docker artifacts.
- IPC access control policies now supports the `"*"` wildcard for policy
  operations.
- Fixed failure when aws-device-sdk-python-v2 calls PublishToIoTCore with a QoS.
- Fixed bug with vending TES credentials to components introduced in v2.1.0.

Docker must be installed and configured in order to pull registry images and run
containers on a Greengrass Lite Core Device. For instructions, view
documentation here:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/run-docker-container.html

# Release Notes v2.1.0

This release includes HTTP proxy support for the AWS Greengrass Nucleus Lite
runtime.

## New with this release

- Added HTTP proxy support that can be configured using the networkProxy
  configuration option
- Lowered the requirement of `libcurl` from 7.86 to 7.82 for devices running
  older versions
- Updates `journalctl` logs so they are attributed to components instead of
  recipe-runner
- Improved error responses for IPC calls
- Added retries for S3 download attempts (for generic component artifacts)
- Minor bug fixes

# Release Notes v2.0.2

This is a minor release that fixes the dependencies of the apt packages to
include cgroup-tools.

# Release Notes v2.0.1

This is a minor release that adds the missing features to support default recipe
of Stream manager v2.2.0.

## New with this release

- Add recipe variable interpolation to greengrass recipe's timeout section
- Add support for ValidateAuthorizationToken IPC command for stream manager
- Fix warnings from Fleet provisioning
- Add retry and backoff to jobs listener

# Release Notes v2.0.0 (Dec 16 2024)

This is the first release of the Greengrass nucleus lite. It aims to be
compatible with the AWS IoT GreenGrass API and the previous Greengrass nucleus
implementations, however currently only a subset of the features are supported
with this release. Expect future releases to reduce the feature gap with
Greengrass nucleus.

In particular, only basic component recipe types are presently supported.
Detailed information can be found [here](./docs/RECIPE_SUPPORT_CHANGES.md).
